Small app that features a simple UI with buttons, text and pictures

This project is the implementation of an important social idea, regarding stray animals that have been sheltered. I have come up with a small design that, we could say, is an animal "Tinder". The base idea consist of a platform full of "shelter" pets, looking for adoptions. This demo represents the base interface seen by the casual user. This platform will complement the administrative one, with extra features. For example, the administrator can allow shelters that are hosting stray animals to upload pictures of the pets, add a small description and add the addres of the shelter, for willing citizens to come and adopt the pet.

This app allows users to create an account, in which they are filling up a simple form. After the registration, you can start browsing for the animals in the database. At this state, all the animals are placeholders. The pictures are from the internet and the details are made up. Should you choose the animal, you will be directed to a menu, that confirms your decision.

Plan for the future development:
1. The most important feature needed to be implemented is an actual database, where photos, details and descriptions can be added.
2. Creating the administrator app, described ahead.
3. Improve the user experience by requesting location, so that the results can reflect the current position of the user.
4. Interface bug-fixing + creating a standard activity template for adding animals.
5. English version for international ussage.(Current language is Romanian).
6. Conectivity with the interent so that adoption requests can be made automatically, removing the need to call the shelter.
